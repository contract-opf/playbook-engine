# Open Playbook Format (OPF) — Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Stable — the first non-beta release. 1.0 is a stability commitment, not a shape change. Format changes from here are governed by the stability policy in §11 (a breaking shape or normative-rule change requires 2.0). The reference compiler emits and validates exactly one document shape, `opf_version` "0.5" (the verdict-free per-deal precedent record, §3.5.4, with the opening evidence of §3.5.5 and a `digest_version` "4" digest, §3.12.2). The 0.1–0.4 shapes and digest 2 were retired (owner decision 2026-10-06: no installed consumer needs them); their schemas and text stay in git history and in contract-opf/opf.
**Serialization:** JSON (canonical). YAML permitted for authoring; tools MUST accept both and treat them as equivalent.
**Issue references:** #NNN citations throughout are design provenance from the project's original development tracker.
**License:** This file is specification text and is additionally licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY-4.0), per the repository `LICENSE` — alongside the Apache-2.0 license covering this repository.

## 0. What changed in 0.2, and why

v0.1 modeled a playbook as a set of **clause positions with a frozen, operative posture per clause** (`rollup.position ∈ {standard, acceptable_variants_exist, negotiable, hold_firm}`). That made sense when the consumer was a less-capable reviewer that needed the answer pre-computed. The consuming review engine is now a SOTA model. Pre-freezing a posture per clause is no longer the right interface: it is rigid where the model is flexible, and it hides the negotiation intent that actually drives a decision.

v0.2 makes one structural move: **determinism migrates out of the knowledge and into the guardrails.**

A playbook is now **one document with three sections**, authored at different times by different owners:

| Section | What it carries | Author | Determinism at runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Evidence** (§3.5) | What the corpus shows — accepted variants, concessions, rejections, each cited to precedent. *Descriptive, not prescriptive.* | Auto-derived by the compiler | **Advisory** — the model reasons over it |
| **Posture** (§3.6) | Negotiation intent as a system-prompt-style prose block (rounds, leverage, risk appetite, what's sacred vs. flexible, output audience). | Compiler **drafts** from a short interview; a legal owner edits | **Soft** — shapes judgment, not a gate |
| **Floor** (§3.7) | The hard lines that must *never* slip: judge-evaluated natural-language invariants. | Legal owner authors (compiler may *propose* candidates) | **Hard** — deterministic coverage gate + forced consequence; the model cannot override |

Plus one new top-level concern: **composition** (§3.4) — an OPF may declare *composed* external clause-intelligence modules (e.g. a privacy/DPA module) rather than re-encoding that knowledge itself: a pinned, validated dependency recorded for lineage under a fixed governance contract. (Behavior wiring is deferred — see §3.4's open note; today `composes` is declared and verified, not yet executed.)

Everything that made v0.1 trustworthy is retained and, in the Floor and citation rules, sharpened: every asserted text still cites precedent (§4); the provenance rule still holds (§2.3); out-of-scope documents are still retained (§3.8). The change is *not* "less governance because the model is smarter" — it is *more* model freedom in the soft middle, bounded by a hard floor it can never cross and a citation it must always give.

This section summarizes the reframe.

---

## 1. Purpose and scope

OPF is an open format for representing a **negotiation playbook** for a single agreement type, compiled from a corpus of real negotiated agreements. A playbook tells a reviewer — human or LLM — how to evaluate a clause in a new agreement: what the preferred position is, what the corpus shows we have accepted, conceded, and rejected, what our negotiation posture is, and what hard lines must never be crossed — each factual claim grounded in cited precedent.

OPF describes **what the playbook knows and intends**, not the review engine's internals (thresholds, retrieval, model policy). OPF is the interface between the corpus→playbook compiler and any downstream review engine.

### Non-goals
- OPF is not a contract format and does not represent agreements themselves.
- OPF does not encode the review engine's thresholds, retrieval, or model policy.
- OPF is not a trained model; it carries no weights.
- OPF does not own the *runtime lifecycle* of an edited Posture. The OPF carries the **initial, compiler-generated** Posture (the genesis record); once a playbook is installed, the consuming app's release-bundle governance owns subsequent Posture versions (§8).

> **OPF vs. the consuming app's release bundle:** OPF is the canonical
> playbook format — knowledge, intent, hard lines, perspective, and de
> minimis. The consuming app's release bundle wraps an
> OPF document and owns model policy, the output/leakage contract, and
> release (version/sign-off/activation/rollback). See
> `docs/OPF-BUNDLE-BOUNDARY.md` for the full boundary statement (supersedes
> the converter framing in #115).

## 2. Core concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Agreement type** | One playbook covers exactly one type (e.g. "Educational Affiliation Agreement"). |
| **Baseline / our paper** | The party's own canonical template, when one exists. Edits against it are *deviations* — the strongest signal. |
| **Counterparty paper** | A document drafted on the other side's template. Clauses surviving here were *tolerated*, not necessarily *endorsed*. |
| **Evidence** | The compiled, cited record of what the corpus shows. Descriptive. (§3.5) |
| **Posture** | Forward-looking negotiation intent, as system-prompt-style prose. (§3.6) |
| **Floor** | The deterministic hard lines that must never slip. (§3.7) |
| **Composition** | A pinned dependency on an external clause-intelligence module. (§3.4) |
| **Observation** | A single occurrence of a clause variant in the corpus, with its outcome and provenance. |
| **Deviation** | How much an observed clause differs from our standard: `none` / `reworded_equivalent` / `substantive`. |
| **Risk delta** | The risk change relative to our standard: a `direction` (`better`/`neutral`/`worse`) and a `magnitude` (`none`/`minor`/`material`). |
| **Outcome** | What happened to an observed variant: `signed` or `proposed_then_reversed` (an explicit rejection). |
| **Provenance** | `our_paper` or `counterparty_paper`. |
| **Historical stance** | A *descriptive* summary of what the corpus shows we have done on a clause (§2.2). Replaces v0.1's prescriptive `rollup.position`. |

### 2.1 The risk-delta model (unchanged from v0.1)

OPF does not carry flat `acceptable_variant` / `concession` labels. An observation carries orthogonal attributes — `deviation`, `risk_delta`, `provenance`, `outcome` — and the human-facing distinction is **derived**:

- *Acceptable variant* = signed observation with `risk_delta.direction = neutral`.
- *Concession* = signed observation with `risk_delta.direction = worse` (magnitude tells you how reluctant).
- *Rejected ask* = observation with `outcome = proposed_then_reversed`.

This keeps the format auditable (you can always see *why* something is a concession) and general across agreement types.

### 2.2 Historical stance is descriptive, not an instruction (the key 0.2 change)

v0.1's `rollup.position` enum tried to be the operative instruction ("hold firm here"). v0.2 replaces it with **`historical_stance`** — a purely *descriptive* summary of the corpus:

> `historical_stance ∈ { consistently_held, usually_held, mixed, usually_conceded, no_signal }`

It answers "**what has the corpus shown we do here?**", never "what must you do here?". A consumer MUST treat `historical_stance` as evidence, not as a directive. What to actually *do* on a live clause is decided by the model from Evidence + Posture + the specifics of the deal in front of it — except where a Floor rule applies, which is non-negotiable (§3.7, §5).

Rationale: the descriptive signal ("we have consistently held the liability cap") is genuinely useful and worth compiling; the *prescription* baked into v0.1's enum is what made it rigid. Splitting description from prescription keeps the signal and removes the rigidity.

### 2.3 The provenance rule (normative — unchanged)

> Only **our-paper** drafting (the canonical template and our-paper deals) MAY define an *opening position* (`our_standard`, and any `historical_stance` stronger than `mixed`).
> **Counterparty-paper** observations MAY only inform tolerance bounds (`fallbacks`, `acceptable_if`) and populate the `clause_library`. A counterparty-paper-only clause MUST NOT set `our_standard`.

Rationale: a clause surviving in the counterparty's template means we failed to strike it, not that we'd propose it. Survivorship is not endorsement.

## 3. Document structure

A playbook is a single JSON object:

```jsonc
{
  "opf_version": "0.5",
  "agreement_type": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "description": "...", "aliases": ["..."] },
  "baseline": { ... },          // §3.2
  "taxonomy": { ... },          // §3.3
  "composes": [ Composition ],  // §3.4 — pinned external module deps (NEW)
  "perspective": { ... },       // §3.1 — whose side this playbook reviews from (NEW)
  "de_minimis": [ "..." ],      // §3.1 — change categories accepted even if novel (NEW)
  "evidence": {                 // §3.5 — the compiled, cited knowledge
    "clauses": [ Clause ],                // one per clause type, with counts (§3.5.4)
    "precedent": [ Precedent ]            // one verdict-free record per (deal, clause type)
  },
  "posture": { ... },           // §3.6 — generated negotiation intent (NEW)
  "floor": { ... },             // §3.7 — hard lines: judged NL invariants (NEW)
  "corpus": { ... },            // §3.8 — provenance/audit + content addresses
  "compiler": { ... },          // §3.9 — generation metadata
  "identity": { ... },          // §3.10 — content hash + section digests (NEW)
  "digest": { ... },            // §3.12 — compact model-facing projection (OPTIONAL)
  "manifest": { ... },          // §3.12.3 — hard-rule manifest, from the Floor (OPTIONAL)
  "dossiers": { ... },          // §3.12.3 — per-clause critic dossiers, bounded by a budget (OPTIONAL)
  "provenance_index": { ... }   // §3.12.3 — where the dossier excerpts came from (OPTIONAL)
}
```

### 3.1 Top-level fields
- `opf_version` (string, required) — `"0.5"`, the one supported version.
- `agreement_type` (object, required) — `id` (slug), `name`, `description`, `aliases[]`.
- `perspective` (object, OPTIONAL) — whose side this playbook is reviewed *as*: `party` (our legal entity/party name) and `counterparty_type` (what the other side typically is, e.g. `"Educational Institution"`). An open-standard OPF instance must say who "us" is — negotiation knowledge is meaningless without it. Owned by OPF (see `OPF-BUNDLE-BOUNDARY.md`).
- `de_minimis` (array of strings, OPTIONAL) — categories of change accepted even when technically novel (e.g. `"typo fixes"`, `"renumbering with no substantive change"`). This is negotiation knowledge, not a runtime policy, so it lives in OPF rather than the consumer's bundle.

  `agreement_type` is the shared cross-tool key for "which contract type is this" — a
  consuming app (e.g. a review tool with its own playbook registry) matches on it rather
  than maintaining a hand-joined mapping between its own key and OPF's.

  - `id` (string, required) — a lowercase slug, `^[a-z0-9-]+$`. Ids are **self-assigned**:
    there is no central registry. An id MAY be bare (`"educational-affiliation"`) or
    self-namespaced by convention (e.g. `"fixturecorp-eiaa"`, org-prefix + hyphen) to reduce the
    chance of collision; namespacing is optional and OPF does not reserve or validate any
    prefix. Two implementers minting the same bare id for different agreement types is a
    collision the format does not prevent — resolve it consumer-side (§`aliases` below, or
    a namespaced id).
  - `name` (string, required) — human-readable label.
  - `description` (string, optional).
  - `aliases` (array of string, optional) — other identifiers this same agreement type is
    known by elsewhere, e.g. a consuming app's own registry/dial key (`"eiaa"`). Aliases
    are free-form strings (no slug pattern enforced) since they mirror whatever key the
    other system already uses. A consumer SHOULD match on `id` first and fall back to
    `aliases` membership before concluding two playbooks describe different agreement
    types.

### 3.2 `baseline`
```jsonc
{
  "has_canonical_template": true,
  "template_ref": { "document_id": "...", "title": "...", "source": "path or URI" },
  "notes": "free text"
}
```
If `has_canonical_template` is `false`, the playbook is *emergent*. The provenance rule still applies; with no template, `our_standard` is set only from our-paper deals, and most stances will be `mixed`/`no_signal`.

### 3.3 `taxonomy`
A curated clause taxonomy (unchanged from v0.1). Entries may be inactive so curation survives upstream taxonomy upgrades. A compiler MUST only classify clauses into `active` or `custom` entries.

How a compiler reached a clause's `taxonomy_id` is the compiler's own record, not part of the format. The reference engine's classification bases are: an exact match of the clause heading to an entry label; heading similarity; a judge's verdict; inheritance from the clause's classified parent; the LLM segmenter's combined pass; and `content_similarity`, a deterministic fallback that assigns a clause every other path left unclassified when its text is close enough to the compiler's own standard text for exactly one entry (a token-overlap score of at least 0.25 and at least twice the runner-up's, at a confidence below 0.70). A content-similarity assignment is a compiler heuristic, never a verified verdict, and the engine assigns nothing on a guess: a clause that scores below the threshold, or whose best and runner-up entries are close, stays unclassified. The engine keeps the basis as the vendor key `x_classification_basis` on its observation store; it is not written into `evidence`, and no section is partitioned by it (prose only; no schema change).
```jsonc
{
  "source": "CUAD-v1",
  "entries": [
    { "id": "indemnification", "label": "Indemnification", "status": "active",
      "cuad_origin": "Indemnification", "description": "Who bears third-party claim risk." }
  ]
}
```

### 3.4 `composes` (NEW) — pinned external clause-intelligence modules

An OPF MAY compose external modules so it does not re-encode clause knowledge that a maintained module already carries (e.g. a privacy/DPA module supplies data-processing clause intelligence to a commercial-agreement playbook).

```jsonc
"composes": [
  {
    "module": "privacy-legal/dpa-review",       // module identifier
    "version": "1.4.0",                          // exact version
    "integrity": "sha256:…",                     // REQUIRED — pinned content hash
    "applies_to_taxonomy": ["data_processing", "confidentiality"],
    "role": "clause_intelligence",               // what it contributes
    "notes": "Supplies DPA/privacy clause positions for data-handling sections."
  }
]
```

**Normative rules:**
1. A composed module is **legal behavior**. Every entry MUST carry an exact `version` and an `integrity` hash. A consumer MUST refuse to load a module that is unpinned, or whose content does not match `integrity` (**fail-closed**) — never silently fall back to "latest". This is the same anti-drift discipline the consuming app applies to its own vendored code.
2. A composed module MAY supply Evidence-equivalent guidance and Floor-equivalent hard lines *for its `applies_to_taxonomy` scope only*. It MUST NOT widen scope beyond what the OPF declares.
3. Where a composed module and the OPF's own Floor conflict, **the stricter rule wins** (a Floor is a one-way ratchet; composition can only add hard lines, never relax them).

> **Open (resolve before implementing composition):** the concrete interface a module exposes — does it hand back structured clause positions, a sub-prompt, a detector set, or all three? — is **not** fixed in 0.2. This section pins the *governance contract* (pin + fail-closed + scope + stricter-wins); the wiring is deferred to one investigation pass against the actual module structure. Until then, `composes` is a declared, validated dependency the runtime records on every review for lineage, even if it does not yet alter behavior.

### 3.5 `evidence` — the compiled, cited knowledge

`evidence` is the compiled, cited record of what the corpus shows —
descriptive, never an instruction. Its shape is §3.5.4's verdict-free
per-deal precedent record.

> **History (retired 2026-10-07, issue #238).** OPF 0.1–0.3 carried a
> different evidence shape: per clause `observed_positions` and a `summary`
> (`historical_stance`, `stance_detail`, `acceptable_if`, `fallbacks`,
> `rejected`, `confidence`; v0.1's `rollup`), a `clause_library` of concepts
> for counterparty paper, and a `negotiation_trail` (formerly §3.5.1–§3.5.3).
> Those categories needed judged verdicts the consumer path no longer
> carries, and the engine no longer reads or writes them. Their text and
> schemas are in this repository's git history and in contract-opf/opf.

#### 3.5.4 The verdict-free per-deal precedent record (OPF 0.4, issue #223; carried by 0.5)

In `opf_version` "0.5" (`spec/playbook.schema-0.5.json`; the record is 0.4's
plus the opening evidence of §3.5.5) judged
deviation/risk verdicts are off the consumer path (the consuming model does
the judging) and the deal is the unit of precedent, so `evidence` carries
facts only:

```jsonc
"evidence": {
  "clauses": [ {                       // one per clause type
    "id": "clause.governing_law", "taxonomy_id": "governing_law", "title": "Governing Law",
    "our_standard": { "text": "...", "source_ref": Citation } | null,
    "n_deals": 6,                      // distinct deals with a precedent for this clause
    "n_signed_standard": 2,            // distinct signed deals that signed our standard
    "n_variants": 2,                   // distinct non-standard texts signed (signed deals)
    "n_refused": 0,                    // distinct refused-ask texts
    "n_opened_standard": 4,            // distinct signed deals whose clause opened with our standard (§3.5.5)
    "n_kept_standard": 2,              // of those, deals that signed our standard
    "n_changed_openings": 0            // distinct non-standard openings not signed as proposed (§3.12.2)
  } ],
  "precedent": [ {                     // one per (deal, clause type)
    "id": "prec.7377a6430df64a98",
    "taxonomy_id": "governing_law", "document_id": "beta-industries",
    "counterparty_ref": { "alias": "Counterparty-2" },        // OPTIONAL
    "paper": "ours" | "theirs" | "unknown", "paper_basis": "provenance_detection",
    "paper_confidence": 0.93 | null,
    "signed": true, "signed_at": "2025-03-14" | "2025-Q1",     // signed_at OPTIONAL
    "rounds": 1,
    "signed_text":  { "text": "...", "ref": Citation } | null,
    "opened_with": "standard" | "non_standard" | "absent" | null,   // §3.5.5
    "opening_text": { "text": "...", "ref": Citation } | null,      // §3.5.5
    "standard": false, "moved": true,
    "refused_asks": [ { "text": "...", "round": 1, "ref": Citation } ]
  } ]
}
```

Field semantics:

- `signed_text` — the deal's terminal text for the clause: the executed copy
  when `signed` is true, the last draft when it is false. `null` when the
  clause was struck before signing.
- `opened_with`, `opening_text` — what the clause opened with, a fact about
  the deal's first draft, whatever its origin and whatever paper the deal is
  on. Defined in §3.5.5. Never fabricated.
- `standard` — `signed_text` is our standard language: an EXACT match after
  normalization (whitespace collapsed; the producer's known party names
  rewritten to one neutral token; case and punctuation dropped; word order,
  negators, modals and numerals kept). Deterministic; never a similarity
  score and never judged. `false` when `signed_text` is `null`. The party
  names are producer configuration (the reference compiler's
  `provenance.our_party_aliases` and `known_entities`), which the document
  does not carry, so `standard` is a producer fact a validator does not
  recompute — and it is NOT the normalization that groups texts (the
  grouping key below).
- `rounds` — distinct negotiation rounds in which the clause changed
  (round `r` is the version transition `r → r+1`); `moved` — the clause
  changed, was struck, or carried a refused ask (always true when
  `opening_text` is non-null).
- `signed_at` — OPTIONAL: when the deal was signed (`YYYY-MM-DD`, or
  `YYYY-Qn` once coarsened for publication). **The reference compiler never
  emits `signed_at`:** it extracts no signing date and never fabricates one,
  so in reference output the field is absent from every precedent and
  §3.12.2's `first_signed`/`last_signed` are always `null`. The field (and
  the `last_signed` ordering it feeds) exists for a third-party producer
  that does record signing dates; the 0.5 conformance vectors that set it
  model such a producer.
- `refused_asks[]` — text proposed during the negotiation and struck before
  signing; `round` is the cited draft's version ordinal − 1 (0 = the
  opening draft).
- `paper` — whose paper the deal is on, three-valued (an ambiguous
  detection is `"unknown"`, never coerced to a side). **Metadata only:** no
  count, list or rule partitions, gates or weights by paper side.
- `id` — `"prec." + sha256(canonical([agreement_type.id, document_id,
  taxonomy_id, signed_text.text or ""]))[:16]` (hex; `canonical` is §3.10's
  canonical JSON). Stable across recompiles of the same evidence.

**Grouping key** (normative). The clause counts below and §3.12.2's digest
group texts — signed variants, refused asks, changed openings — by an exact key computed from
the text and the document alone, so a validator or an independent port
recomputes it with nothing but the document. It differs from `standard`'s
normalization only in its party names: `standard` neutralizes the
producer's configured names, which the document does not carry (a key built
from them could not be recomputed), while the key neutralizes only the party
identifiers the document itself carries — the counterparty's entity-registry
alias and `perspective.party` — each to its own token. In order (steps 2–4
are `standard`'s normalization with `perspective.party` as its only party
name):

1. Every entity-registry alias — `Counterparty-` followed by one or more
   ASCII digits, matched case-insensitively, with no word character (a
   Unicode alphanumeric character or underscore) immediately before or
   after — is replaced by the token `counterparty`. Each deal's
   counterparty carries its own alias in the clause text, so without this
   the same words signed with two counterparties would be two variants.
2. Every whitespace run is collapsed to one space.
3. When the document has a non-blank `perspective.party` (§3.1), every
   occurrence of it (its own whitespace runs collapsed to one space;
   matched case-insensitively, with no word character immediately before
   or after) is replaced by the token `party`. No other party name is
   applied.
4. The text is lowercased, every character that is neither a word
   character nor whitespace is replaced by a space, whitespace runs are
   collapsed to one space, and the ends are trimmed.

Two texts group together only when their keys are equal: word order,
negators, modals and numerals all survive, and our party (`party`) and the
counterparty (`counterparty`) stay distinct tokens, so the same words with
the parties' places swapped are a separate group. The reference
implementation is `precedent.normalize_variant_text`; 0.5 conformance
vector 004 pins it. The same key decides whether an opening is distinct
(§3.5.5).

Normative rules (a conformant validator MUST enforce each; the schema
cannot express them):

- Every `precedent[].id` is unique and equals its recomputed value.
- At most one precedent per (`document_id`, `taxonomy_id`) — the deal is the
  unit of precedent.
- Every `precedent[].taxonomy_id` names an `evidence.clauses[]` entry; every
  `precedent[].document_id` resolves to `corpus.documents[]`, and `signed`
  agrees with that document's `signed_version` (non-null ⇔ `signed`) when
  recorded. `standard: true` requires a non-null `signed_text`.
- Each clause's `n_deals` / `n_signed_standard` / `n_variants` / `n_refused` /
  `n_opened_standard` / `n_kept_standard` / `n_changed_openings`
  equal what `precedent` implies (grouping texts by the grouping key above —
  not by `standard`'s normalization, whose party names are not in the
  document). Every count is distinct deals or distinct texts — never rows.
- Every citation in `evidence` resolves (§4).
- The opening-evidence rules of §3.5.5.

No stance, band, risk or deviation verdict appears anywhere in a 0.5
`evidence` or `digest`. A producer that ran a judged pass MAY carry its
verdicts under the root vendor extension `x_judgments` (`[{precedent_id,
...}]`, §10.1) — never inside `evidence.precedent`, whose records are
closed (`additionalProperties: false`, no `x_*`). The reference producer
(`playbook-engine`) runs no such pass and emits none.

#### 3.5.5 OPF 0.5 — what each clause opened with (issue #233)

A signed variant means much more when the record says where the deal
started: "we opened with our standard and signed X" makes X a concession on
record, and "they opened with Y and we signed our standard" means Y did not
survive. 0.5 therefore records, for every precedent, what the clause opened
with — as a **fact**, never a meaning. Whether an opening was held,
conceded or moved to standard is derived by the consumer (or the digest) from
`opened_with`, `opening_text` and `signed_text`; the record classifies none of
it. Our paper and third-party paper yield the same kind of evidence: the
opening on counterparty paper is almost never our standard, so a rule gated
on origin would starve it. Paper side stays metadata.

Definitions (normative):

- **First draft.** The first version in the deal's negotiation order (the
  net diff's before side). For a single-version signed deal it is the signed
  copy itself.
- **First-draft text of a clause type.** Every first-draft node bound into an
  aligned row of that `taxonomy_id` — removed rows, and rows whose text still
  occurs in the signed copy, included — joined with a newline in the order of
  the nodes' `char_span` (path order when spans are absent). Its `ref` cites
  the first of those nodes. The row's `taxonomy_id` is the alignment's, the
  same one the terminal record uses.
- **`opened_with`**, required, one of:
  - `"standard"` — the first-draft text is our standard language. This is the
    check `standard` uses (an exact match after normalization against the
    whole template clause, with the producer's party names).
  - `"non_standard"` — it is present but not standard, including when the
    clause type has no template clause.
  - `"absent"` — the first draft has no node bound to the clause type, but a
    later draft or the signed copy does: the clause was added during the
    negotiation. A first-draft clause that the producer left unclassified
    reads as absent too: `"absent"` is a fact about the clause type's
    aligned nodes, not about the document text.
  - `null` — not determined: the deal has no detected executed copy
    (`signed` false, an unsigned deal's version order is not anchored), or
    the producer predates this field. `null` is never `"absent"`.
- **`opening_text`** — `{text, ref}` of the first-draft text. Recorded when
  `opened_with` is `"standard"` or `"non_standard"` AND either `signed_text`
  is `null` (the clause was struck, or relocated away) or the §3.5.4 grouping
  key of the opening differs from that of `signed_text`. Otherwise `null`: a
  clause that opened with its signed text, or whose only edit is case,
  whitespace or punctuation, has no distinct opening. `null` still means
  "not recorded / not distinct", never "opened with the signed text" when
  `opened_with` is `null`.

Normative rules (a conformant validator MUST enforce each):

- `signed` false ⇒ `opened_with` is `null` and `opening_text` is `null`.
- `opened_with` is `"absent"` or `null` ⇒ `opening_text` is `null`.
- `opening_text` non-null ⇒ its grouping key differs from that of
  `signed_text` (or `signed_text` is `null`), and `moved` is `true`.

A struck opening needs no origin claim: a clause type's first-draft text that
was struck before signing is recorded as `opening_text` with `signed_text`
`null` even when the producer cannot tell whether it was our language or the
counterparty's. It is not claimed as a refused ask, which keeps its
origin-gated definition (`refused_asks[]`, §3.5.4). A first-draft node whose
text is relocated, not struck (it occurs verbatim in the signed copy under
another clause), produces no opening and no struck record.

#### 3.5.6 OPF 0.5 — `vs_standard`, the equivalence label (issue #240)

The exact-match `standard` fact answers only "did they sign our words
unchanged". On counterparty paper that is almost always false even where the
concept is the same, and grouping signed variants by exact text turns one
concept phrased five ways into five one-deal variants. 0.5 therefore lets a
producer judge each DISTINCT text once against our standard and carry the
answer as an index the consumer's model can check against the cited text. It
is an index, never an instruction, and it is the one place a judged verdict
appears in `evidence` (owner decision (c) of issue #227, narrowed for this
label only; every other fact in the record stays verdict-free).

`vs_standard` is an OPTIONAL key (a producer SHOULD always write it; absent
is read as `null`) on `signed_text`, `opening_text` and each `refused_asks[]`
entry of a precedent record:

```json
"vs_standard": {
  "label":  "equivalent" | "more_protective" | "less_protective" | "different_concept",
  "reason": "<one sentence naming the operative difference; no deal names>",
  "basis":  "judge" | "agent" | "owner",
  "check":  {"agreed": true, "by": "<checker model id>", "adjudicated": false} | null
} | null
```

- `label` is relative to `perspective.party`: `equivalent` is the same legal
  effect as our standard, `more_protective` / `less_protective` better /
  worse for that party, `different_concept` does something our standard does
  not (or omits what it does), so the two cannot be ranked.
- `basis` names who produced the verdict. `owner` is an after-the-fact
  correction and wins over any agent or check answer; it is never checked.
- `check` is the independent blind check of the verdict. `agreed: true`: the
  checker, who never saw the verdict, reached the same label. `agreed: false,
  adjudicated: false`: it did not, and the disagreement awaits adjudication
  (the verdict shown is still the draft). `agreed: false, adjudicated: true`:
  a fresh agent saw both answers and its label is the verdict. `null`: not
  checked yet. A consumer reads an unchecked or disputed label as weaker
  evidence than an agreed or adjudicated one, and never blocks on it.
- `null` means "not yet judged", never a guess. It is the only value for: a
  signed text whose `standard` fact is true (an exact match is equivalent by
  definition); any text of a clause whose `our_standard` is `null` (emergent
  mode: nothing to compare with); an opening whose `opened_with` is
  `"standard"`. A refused ask, a non-standard opening and a non-standard
  signed text are judged.
- **Cache key (the identity of "the same text").** A verdict is shared by every
  deal, paper side and role carrying the same text: `sha256` over the JSON
  array `[agreement_type.id, taxonomy_id, perspective.party, K(text),
  K(our_standard.text)]`, where `K` is the §3.5.4 grouping key. The paper
  side, the document id, the role and the opening draft are not part of it.
  What a judge is shown carries none of them either: the taxonomy id and
  title, `perspective.party`, our standard, the candidate text and its roles.

Normative rules (a conformant validator MUST enforce each):

- A non-null `vs_standard` MUST NOT appear on a signed text whose `standard`
  is `true`, nor on a text of a clause whose `our_standard` is `null`.
- `check.adjudicated` `true` ⇒ `check.agreed` is `false`.
- When the producing run's verdict store is available, every non-null
  `vs_standard` MUST have a stored verdict under its cache key carrying the
  same label (a label the run never produced is invented).

The reference compiler drafts verdicts with the `playbook-from-corpus` skill
(`playbook judge` queues one `equivalence` item per distinct eligible text
once a template is configured), checks every draft with a separate
`claude-opus-5-5` / `xhigh` agent (`playbook judge --check equivalence`,
`playbook judge-apply --check`), writes the labels at `playbook project` and
reports drafted / checked / agreed / adjudicated / unchecked counts in
`playbook scorecard`. Digest 4 (issue #234) uses the labels to collapse
equivalent variants into one entry (§3.12.2).

### 3.6 `posture` (NEW) — negotiation intent as generated prose

The Posture is the "smart, system-prompt-style directions" layer: a prose block that tells the review engine *how to negotiate this agreement type*, generated by the compiler from a short interview (§7) and grounded in the Evidence.

> **What "grounded" and "generated" mean for the reference producer:** this spec does not mandate free-form LLM drafting. The reference producer (`playbook-engine`) assembles `system_prompt` **deterministically** — one governed prose sentence per interview answer, concatenated in canonical order, not model-written. "Grounded in the Evidence" here means the interview options presented to the author are themselves computed from the compiled Evidence section, and `generation.grounded_in` records the Evidence digest the interview was run against — not that an LLM read Evidence text while composing prose. A conformant producer MAY instead offer a richer, LLM-authored draft; if it does, that draft is still subject to the same versioning and human-approval discipline as any Posture edit (§8).

```jsonc
"posture": {
  "system_prompt": "This is a generally low-risk agreement type; default toward ACCEPT. We typically go two negotiation rounds before escalating. Hold firm on the liability cap and on declining indemnification (see Floor). Term, notice periods, and renewal mechanics are flexible to close. Write rationale tersely for a GC audience…",
  "version": 1,                            // governed counter (NEW, issue #156) — bumped when a re-run of the interview actually changes the content (issue #132: a byte-identical re-run is a no-op)
  "generation": {                          // provenance: how the prompt was produced
    "generated_by": "playbook-engine vX.Y.Z",
    "generated_at": "ISO-8601 (supplied by caller)",
    "interview": [
      { "q": "rounds", "question": "How many rounds…", "answer": "Usually 2." },
      { "q": "leverage", "question": "Default leverage posture?", "answer": "Collaborative; we often want the deal." }
      // … see §7 for the canonical question set
    ],
    "grounded_in": "evidence@<digest>"     // the Evidence state the draft was written against
  }
}
```

**Normative rules:**
1. `system_prompt` is **legal behavior**. The OPF carries the *initial, compiler-generated* version (the genesis record). A consumer that lets a human edit the Posture MUST treat each edit as a governed version bump (§8) — versioned, diffed, re-approved, rollback-able — never a free-text field that silently changes production behavior. The producer itself already versions its own genesis Posture: `version` starts at `1` and is incremented by 1 each time the compiler's interview (§7) is re-run against an existing Posture **with different answers** (issue #156) — this is the OPF-side half of "governed"; a consumer's edit-time versioning (§8) picks up from there. A re-run whose answers are byte-identical to the existing Posture is a no-op: `version` is left untouched rather than bumped for a revision that never happened (issue #132) — a producer MUST NOT advance `version` on a re-run it can determine made no actual change.
2. The `generation.interview` record is **provenance**: it lets an auditor see *why* the Posture says what it says. It MUST be retained.
3. The Posture MUST NOT restate or contradict the Floor. The Floor is the authority on hard lines; the Posture may *reference* it ("hold firm on X, see Floor") but a Floor invariant binds regardless of Posture text (§5). Per issue #156's decided direction (2026-07-10): a Posture that appears to soften language around a Floor-protected concept is a **SHOULD-warn** (judgment-first, non-blocking) that a conformant validator surfaces for human review — not a hard validation error.
4. The Posture is **soft** at runtime (§5): it shapes the model's judgment; it is not a gate and cannot, by itself, force or suppress a decision the way a Floor rule does.

### 3.7 `floor` (NEW) — the hard lines

The Floor is the small, explicit set of things that must **never** slip — un-overridable by the model under review and by the Posture. It absorbs what an earlier design split out as a separate "review-overlay"; here it is a section of the one knowledge artifact, authored by the legal owner.

A Floor entry is a **natural-language invariant**: one checkable statement a judge can evaluate against a clause in isolation. There is no lexical detector grammar — an earlier draft's term-matching design was superseded (2026-07-09, #145) because real hard lines ("never accept uncapped liability") are semantic, not lexical.

```jsonc
"floor": {
  "invariants": [
    {
      "id": "no-uncapped-liability",
      "statement": "Never accept uncapped liability.",
      "rationale": "Uncapped exposure is categorically unacceptable regardless of deal value."
    },
    {
      "id": "no-one-way-indemnity",
      "statement": "Never give one-way indemnification flowing only from us.",
      "rationale": "We do not give indemnification on this paper without reciprocity."
    }
  ]
}
```

An invariant MAY carry vendor-namespace keys (§10.1) that feed the hard-rule manifest (§3.12.3): `x_taxonomy_id` (the clause type it is about), `x_required_presence` (boolean), `x_condition` (a predicate spec or `"judged"`) and `x_permissible_proof` (list of strings). A validator rejects a malformed one. `playbook floor sign --clause ... --requires-presence --condition ... --proof ...` writes them.

**Normative rules:**
1. **Evaluation is judgment; coverage and consequence are deterministic.** A dedicated Floor judge — separate from the model doing the review — evaluates each invariant against the clause under review and returns `clear`, `violation`, or `needs_review`. The consumer's deterministic obligations are the **coverage gate** (every invariant present MUST be evaluated and logged on every review; an unevaluated invariant fails the run, fail-closed) and the **consequence rule** (a `violation` verdict forces the negotiation-unacceptable outcome; `needs_review` forces human escalation; the model under review and the Posture can override neither).
2. One Floor, both paper contexts: the same invariants are judged whether reviewing our paper's diff or the counterparty paper's extracted clauses — not two modes.
3. The invariants are OPTIONAL as a section (a corpus-only compile ships zero invariants) but never fabricated: the engine MUST NOT derive active invariants without sign-off.
4. The compiler MAY **propose** Floor candidates (every `outcome: proposed_then_reversed` in the Evidence is a candidate hard line). The legal owner finalizes and signs. A compiler MUST NOT auto-promote a candidate to an active invariant without sign-off. This bars promoting a *compiler-derived* candidate — a machine inference read off the Evidence — without an explicit accept decision; it does not bar recording a *human-authored* statement (e.g. the Posture interview's `sacred_clauses` answer, OPF §7) as an active invariant directly, since the human act of writing it is itself the sign-off, not an auto-promotion of a machine inference.

#### 3.7.1 Floor admission test (keep the Floor minimal)

The Floor's danger is that it slowly grows back into the rigid per-clause playbook v0.2 set out to retire. A rule belongs in the Floor **only if both** hold:

> **(a) Categorical** — crossing it is unacceptable *regardless of deal value, leverage, or round* (no "it depends"); **and**
> **(b) Statable as a single checkable invariant** — one sentence a judge can evaluate against a clause in isolation, without deal context or cross-clause reasoning.

Anything that fails (a) is **Posture** (intent the model weighs). Anything that fails (b) is **Evidence** — cited material the model reasons over in context (e.g. "payment terms are usually negotiable but watch the offsets" is guidance, not an invariant). A conformant producer SHOULD warn when a Floor is large relative to the taxonomy (a smell that prescription is leaking back into the Floor).

### 3.8 `corpus` (audit trail + content addresses)
```jsonc
{
  "documents": [
    { "document_id": "…", "title": "…", "provenance": "our_paper",
      "in_scope": true, "scope_rationale": "…", "scope_confidence": 0.93,
      "versions": 5, "signed_version": 5, "version_order_basis": "edit_distance_chain+signed_anchor",
      "version_files": [                         // per-version content addresses (§4.1)
        { "version": 1, "sha256": "sha256:…", "media_type": "application/pdf" },
        { "version": 2, "sha256": "sha256:…", "media_type": "application/pdf",
          "source_uri": "dms://…" }              // OPTIONAL; private profiles only
      ] }
  ],
  "stats": { "documents_total": 12, "documents_in_scope": 10, "versions_total": 37 },
  "snapshot": {                                  // names the exact corpus state compiled from
    "manifest_hash": "sha256:…"                  // sha256 of canonical JSON of sorted
  }                                              //   [(document_id, version, sha256), …]
}
```
Out-of-scope documents MUST be retained here with `in_scope: false` and a `scope_rationale` — never silently dropped.

- `version_files[].sha256` addresses the **original source file bytes**
  (the staged input, pre-extraction), keyed by the same inferred ordinal
  citations use. One entry per mined version; failed-ingest versions stay
  visible in the producer's ingest record instead.
- **Publication rule:** hashes of confidential files leak nothing, so
  `version_files` (and `snapshot`) are publication-safe. `source_uri` — a
  path/URI into someone's DMS — is NOT, so a producer preparing a
  document for release strips it.
- `snapshot.manifest_hash` is the OPF-side analogue of a consumer's
  `corpus_snapshot_version`: one value naming the corpus state, stable
  across identical recompiles.

### 3.9 `compiler`
```jsonc
{ "name": "playbook-engine", "version": "x.y.z", "run_id": "…", "generated_at": "ISO-8601 (supplied by caller)" }
```

### 3.10 `identity` (NEW) — content hash + section digests

```jsonc
{
  "id": "…",             // OPTIONAL — producer-assigned playbook identifier
  "version": "…",        // OPTIONAL — producer-assigned version label
  "supersedes": "…",     // OPTIONAL — the playbook this one supersedes
  "content_hash": "sha256:…",
  "section_digests": { "evidence": "sha256:…", "posture": "sha256:…", "floor": "sha256:…" }
}
```

Gives the playbook artifact identity: a canonical serialization, a content
hash, and per-section digests, so a consumer can record which exact playbook
governed which document and lineage is reconstructible end to end (§8).

- **Canonical form** (normative): the JSON value with object keys sorted
  recursively, no insignificant whitespace, UTF-8. Array order is untouched
  (semantic). See `playbook_engine/canonicalize.py` for the reference
  implementation.
- **`content_hash`** — `sha256:` + hex digest of the canonical form of the
  *whole document*, excluding two things so the hash is neither
  self-referential nor perturbed by non-content run metadata: the
  `identity` object itself (it is where `content_hash` is written), and
  `compiler.generated_at` / `compiler.run_id` (wall-clock/run-id, not
  content). Two compiles of byte-identical corpus content hash identically
  regardless of when or under what run they were produced.
- **`section_digests`** — `sha256:` + hex digest of each of `evidence` /
  `posture` / `floor`'s own canonical bytes, computed
  independently of the rest of the document. This is the `<digest>`
  referenced by `posture.generation.grounded_in: "evidence@<digest>"` (§7)
  and by the lineage fields a consumer must record (§8).
- **`id` / `version` / `supersedes`** are producer-assigned lineage
  metadata — like `compiler.run_id`, the engine cannot derive them from the
  corpus, so they are recorded only when a caller supplies them and are
  never fabricated. They deliberately do NOT participate in `content_hash`:
  identical content compiled twice under a new version/supersedes label
  still hashes identically (mirrors excluding `compiler.run_id`/
  `generated_at`).
- `identity` is OPTIONAL at the top level (not every producer populates it),
  but when present `content_hash` and `section_digests` are both required —
  a partial identity block is not conformant.

### 3.11 (removed)

OPF 0.4 and earlier carried an optional top-level `curation` section of
attorney-pinned clause positions. OPF 0.5 has no `curation` section (issue
#233; the review loop that produced pins was retired in issue #239). The
0.5 schema rejects a document that carries a top-level `curation` key, and
`identity.section_digests` has no `curation` digest. Section number 3.11 is
left unassigned so the numbering of later sections is stable.

### 3.12 `digest` (OPTIONAL) — the compact model-facing projection

A full OPF document carries every precedent's text and can run to millions
of characters on a real corpus — far beyond a model context. The `digest`
section is the compact projection designed to BE the system-prompt payload
of a consuming review application.

Normative rules:

- The digest MUST NOT contain `full_text` anywhere — drill-down goes through
  its citations against the full document.
- When present, `digest.clauses[].id` MUST exactly match
  `evidence.clauses[].id` (same set).
- `digest_version` (string, required) versions the digest shape itself,
  independent of `opf_version`.
- The digest is a pure function of the document and participates in
  `identity.content_hash` like any other content section.
- OPTIONAL in the schema; the reference compiler always emits it. Producers
  targeting ~40K tokens (chars/4) satisfy the intent.

An OPF 0.5 document carries `digest_version` "4" (§3.12.2).

> **History (retired 2026-10-07, issue #238).** `digest_version` "2" was the
> digest of an OPF 0.3 document (stances, preferred variations, frequency-
> banded exemplar forms). It was retired with 0.3; its definition and
> conformance vectors are in git history.
>
> **History (replaced in place 2026-10-09, issue #234).** `digest_version` "3"
> (per clause: our standard, the deal counts, the grouped signed variants and
> refused asks) is replaced by digest 4, which is digest 3 plus the fields of
> §3.12.2. Nothing consumed digest 3; the engine emits and validates only
> digest 4, and its definition and vectors are in git history.

#### 3.12.1 `digest_version` "3" (retired)

Replaced in place by digest 4 (§3.12.2, issue #234). Section number left
unassigned so the numbering of §3.12.2 is stable.

#### 3.12.2 `digest_version` "4" (OPF 0.5, issues #223, #234, #240)

The verdict-free projection of §3.5.4's precedent record, plus the one judged
index of §3.5.6 (`vs_standard.label`):

```jsonc
"digest": {
  "digest_version": "4",
  "perspective": { "party": "...", "counterparty_type": "..." } | null,  // copy of §3.1
  "agreement_type": { "id": "...", "name": "..." },

      { "label": "equivalent", "n_deals": 3, "n_texts": 2, "n_from_standard": 1,
        "n_unchanged": 2, "last_signed": null,
        "exemplars": [ { "text": "...", "ref": Citation } ],       // at most two
        "precedent_ids": ["prec.…"] }                               // the collapsed entry
    ],
    "refused_asks":    [ { "text": "...", "n_deals": 1, "label": ... | null,
                           "ref": Citation, "precedent_ids": ["prec.…"] } ],
    "changed_openings": [ { "text": "...", "n_deals": 3, "n_to_standard": 1, "n_struck": 1,
                            "label": ... | null, "ref": Citation, "precedent_ids": ["prec.…"] } ],
    "n_variants_total": 2, "n_refused_total": 0, "n_changed_openings_total": 1
  } ],
  "uncovered_clause_types": [ { "taxonomy_id": "...", "label": "..." } ]
}
```

- `perspective` is always present (`null` when the document has none): a
  consumer reading only the digest still knows which side it reviews for.
- `corpus.n_deals` / `n_signed` count in-scope `corpus.documents` (signed:
  `signed_version` non-null); `first_signed`/`last_signed` are the
  earliest/latest precedent `signed_at` (`null` when none is recorded —
  always, in reference-compiler output, which never emits `signed_at`
  (§3.5.4); likewise every `signed_variants[].last_signed`, so the
  `last_signed` ordering key only applies to a producer that records
  signing dates).
- Every count is distinct signed deals read from `evidence.precedent` with
  `signed: true`; paper side partitions nothing.
- `n_opened_standard` — deals whose `opened_with` is `"standard"`;
  `n_kept_standard` — of those, deals whose `standard` is `true`. Both equal
  the same-named `evidence.clauses[]` counts.
- `positions` — the signed deals that signed a text for the clause, by what
  that text is: `standard` (the signed text is our standard language; equals
  `n_signed_standard`), each `vs_standard.label` (§3.5.6) of a non-standard
  signed text, and `unjudged` (a non-standard signed text with no label).
  All six keys are always present.
- `signed_variants` — the non-standard `signed_text` of signed deals,
  grouped by §3.5.4's grouping key (exact; counterparty aliases and
  `perspective.party` neutralized — not `standard`'s configured party
  names); `n_deals` distinct deals; `text` is the sentence-boundary summary
  (≤ 300 chars) of the group's representative (latest `signed_at`, then
  lowest `document_id`) and `ref` its citation. Within a tier the order is
  `n_deals` desc, `last_signed` desc (unknown last), then grouping key.
  - `n_from_standard` — deals in the group whose `opened_with` is
    `"standard"`: the variant is a concession from our standard on record.
  - `n_unchanged` — deals in the group whose `opened_with` is
    `"non_standard"` and whose `opening_text` is `null`: signed exactly as it
    opened. (`"absent"` and `null` count in neither.)
  - `label` — the representative's `vs_standard.label`, or `null` when it is
    not judged. An index to check against the cited text, never an
    instruction. The label is orthogonal to the opening facts: a variant can
    be both a concession and `equivalent`.
  - **Collapse.** Every group whose `label` is `equivalent` is replaced by ONE
    entry (always last): `{label: "equivalent", n_deals (distinct deals
    across the collapsed groups), n_texts (groups collapsed), n_from_standard,
    n_unchanged (summed), last_signed (latest), exemplars (the first two
    groups in the order above, each {text, ref}), precedent_ids (all)}`. It
    has no `text` or `ref` of its own.
  - **Order.** Individual entries come in four tiers: `less_protective` and
    `different_concept` first, then those with a `null` label, then
    `more_protective`; the collapsed entry closes the list.
- `refused_asks` — every refused ask, grouped the same way, representative
  the earliest-round ask (then lowest `document_id`), with the
  representative's `label`; ordered `n_deals` desc, then grouping key.
- `changed_openings` — non-standard opening language that was not signed as
  proposed: precedents with `opened_with` `"non_standard"` and a non-null
  `opening_text`, excluding a precedent whose opening's grouping key equals
  the grouping key of one of its own `refused_asks` (already shown as a
  refused ask). Grouped by the grouping key of `opening_text.text`; `text`
  and `ref` are the summary and citation of the representative (lowest
  `document_id`); `n_to_standard` counts deals whose `standard` is `true`,
  `n_struck` deals whose `signed_text` is `null`; `label` is the
  representative's. Ordered `n_deals` desc, then grouping key.
- The three lists are capped together (top 5, tightened stepwise to 1 until
  the digest fits the ~40K-token budget), the cap applying after the
  equivalent variants collapse. `n_variants_total` / `n_refused_total` /
  `n_changed_openings_total` are always the uncapped totals of distinct texts
  and equal `evidence.clauses[].n_variants` / `n_refused` /
  `n_changed_openings`.
- `uncovered_clause_types` — every classifier-eligible `taxonomy.entries[]`
  entry (`status` `active` or `custom`) with no `evidence.clauses[]` entry,
  `{taxonomy_id, label}`, sorted by `taxonomy_id`, never capped. It means "a
  recognised clause type with no precedent in this corpus", nothing more.
- No `full_text`; no stance, band, risk or deviation field.
- **When present, the digest MUST equal the reference construction over the
  document** (`build_digest_v4`, defined by the 0.5 conformance vectors,
  §10.2) — a validator recomputes it and rejects any difference. A
  transform that edits evidence text (publication, residue redaction) MUST
  re-derive the digest, precedent ids and counts afterwards.

The single-file page artifact (`index.html`, produced by
`playbook view bundle`) embeds the canonical OPF JSON and the digest in
`<script type="application/json">` blocks (ids `opf-canonical`/`opf-digest`,
with every `<` escaped as `\u003c`; JSON parsing restores the value). The bare
`playbook.opf.json` remains the canonical artifact — a consumer extracts the
block and verifies `identity.content_hash` over the canonical serialization.

#### 3.12.3 `manifest`, `dossiers`, `provenance_index` (OPF 0.5, issue #228)

Three more OPTIONAL top-level sections the reference compiler always emits
beside the digest, so a consumer can enforce hard-rejection recall outside
both models and give its critic pass bounded, deeper context. Like the digest
each is a **pure function of the document**: a validator recomputes it
(`playbook_engine/dossiers.py`, defined by vector 008, §10.2) and rejects any
difference, and each participates in `identity.content_hash`. None holds a
judged verdict. A writer that changes the Floor after assembly
(`playbook floor sign`, the Posture interview's Q4 promotion) MUST re-derive
them before restamping `identity`.

**`manifest`** — `{hard_rules: [...]}`, one rule per `floor.invariants[]`
entry, in Floor order, and **only from the signed Floor, never from precedent
counts**: `{rule_id, clause_id, taxonomy_id, statement, required_presence,
condition, permissible_proof, fallback_language}`.

- `rule_id` is the invariant's `id`; `statement` its text, verbatim.
- `taxonomy_id` is the invariant's `x_taxonomy_id` and `clause_id` the
  `evidence.clauses[].id` of that clause type; both `null` when the invariant
  names none, and `clause_id` `null` when the corpus has no evidence for it.
- `required_presence` — the clause's absence or deletion is a hard rejection.
  The invariant's `x_required_presence`; `false` when unstated (an invariant
  that does not say the clause must appear never demands its presence).
- **A rule that demands presence or carries a predicate names its clause.** An
  invariant with `x_required_presence` `true`, or an `x_condition` other than
  `"judged"`, MUST also carry `x_taxonomy_id`: a predicate is checked against
  the text of the clause it names, and a presence rule rejects that clause's
  absence, so a rule with no clause could not be enforced by a consumer
  outside both models. The validator, `playbook floor sign` and the schema
  (`$defs.hardRule`: `taxonomy_id` is a string whenever `required_presence`
  is `true` or `condition` is a predicate) all refuse the unanchored form. An
  invariant that states neither is a `"judged"` rule and may name no clause.
- `condition` — a deterministic predicate spec the consumer evaluates outside
  any model, or the string `"judged"` for a rule that is not machine-evaluable
  (the default, and the only value when `x_condition` is absent). The specs:
  `{"type": "required_phrases", "phrases": [...], "match": "all"|"any"}` (the
  clause text contains every, or any, phrase, compared case-insensitively on
  normalized whitespace); `{"type": "numeric_bound", "pattern": "<regex with
  exactly one capture group>", "min"?: n, "max"?: n, "unit"?: s}` (the number
  captured is within the bounds); `{"type": "cross_reference", "clause_id":
  "..."}` (the clause text cross-references that clause).
- `permissible_proof` — what a reviewed document may show to satisfy the rule
  (`x_permissible_proof`, else `[]`).
- `fallback_language` — the clause's `our_standard.text` to insert when the
  protection is absent; `null` when the clause has no standard.

**`dossiers`** — `{clause id: dossier}`, one per `evidence.clauses[]` entry,
bounded by a **budget** and carrying **at most two precedent excerpts**:
`{clause_id, taxonomy_id, title, our_standard: {text}|null, n_floor_rules,
floor_rules: [{rule_id, statement, rationale?}] (at most three, fewer when
dropped for size; `n_floor_rules` counts every one), excerpts, n_omitted,
omitted_precedent_ids}`. The rationale is the signed Floor's own
words for the clause (its `x_taxonomy_id` invariants) and the excerpts are the
edge cases and counter-arguments on record. A dossier carries no count (the
digest has them). Nothing is judged and nothing is summarised by a model.

**No text is ever cut part-way.** Every excerpt text (`opening`, `signed`),
our standard and every listed Floor rule appears **whole** or not at all: a
cut-off clause can drop its operative carve-out or cap and so plant a false
fact. There are no prefix cuts and no ellipsis truncation.

An **excerpt** is one precedent record rendered as an opening-to-signed pair,
`{precedent_id, kind, opening, signed, outcome}`: `opening` is the record's
`opening_text` and `signed` its `signed_text`, verbatim; with no recorded
`opening_text` the excerpt is the signed text alone (`opening` `null`); a
record whose clause was struck before signing has `signed` `null` and
`outcome` `struck_before_signing`. Selection is deterministic, in this order,
each candidate contributing one record of its group, and a group or a record
already chosen being skipped, until two are chosen:

1. the first digest-4 `signed_variants` group with `n_from_standard` > 0 (a
   concession on record; `kind` `signed_variant`), its record taken only
   among the members whose clause opened with our standard (`opened_with`
   "standard"), so the excerpt is the concession's own opening-to-signed
   pair;
2. the first `changed_openings` group (language that did not survive as
   proposed; `kind` `changed_opening`);
3. the remaining `signed_variants` groups, in digest-4 order, then the
   `refused_asks` groups (`kind` `refused_ask`: `opening` is the ask, `signed`
   what the deal signed instead, `outcome` `ask_refused`).

A group's record is its (eligible) member with the latest `signed_at`
(unknown last), **ties broken on the lowest `precedent_id`** (code-point
order). This is not the record the digest cites (§3.12.2 breaks its ties on
`document_id`). A `refused_asks` group's record is chosen the same way among
the records that made the ask, and the excerpt shows that record's
earliest-round ask in the group. The collapsed `equivalent` entry of the
digest stands for its groups in group order: step 1 takes the first of them
with `n_from_standard` > 0, step 3 the first of them. Adding precedents can
change which excerpts appear and so the texts the dossier holds, never add
to it: a precedent that leaves the selection unchanged leaves the dossier
byte-identical.

**Budget.** A dossier's budget is `max(1000, 3 × tokens(our_standard.text))`
tokens (a text's tokens are its characters / 4; a dossier's size is its
canonical JSON characters / 4), or 1,000 when the clause has no
`our_standard`: a clause whose own standard is long is not forced to drop the
evidence beside it. When a dossier is over budget, **whole parts are
dropped**, never cut, in this order:

1. the **listed Floor rules, last first**, while the dossier holding only its
   first excerpt (none, when the clause has none) is still over budget: a
   rule gives way only to the parts that are never dropped, which are our
   standard, the clause's identifiers and that first excerpt. `n_floor_rules`
   still counts every rule, and the manifest states each one verbatim;
2. then the **excerpts, in reverse selection order, keeping the first**,
   until the dossier fits. A dossier **always keeps at least one complete
   excerpt** (when the clause has any).

So a Floor rule is listed in preference to a second excerpt, and a second
excerpt is never dropped when it fits beside the rules left listed. Our
standard and the clause's identifiers are never dropped (the budget is at
least three times our standard's tokens). A dossier may exceed its budget in
**one case only**: it holds its single kept excerpt, every listed Floor rule
dropped, and keeping that excerpt whole puts it over. The scorecard counts
every such dossier as `over_budget_single_excerpt`. Any other dossier over its
budget is invalid: a validator refuses one with two excerpts, or with none
(its standard and identifiers alone exceed the budget). Each dropped excerpt
is named: `n_omitted` is their number and `omitted_precedent_ids` their
`precedent_id`s, sorted, so the critic knows more evidence exists; each
resolves through the provenance index (below) to its deal, and by id to its
record in `evidence.precedent`. Selection order, determinism and
byte-identical re-runs are unchanged by the budget.

**`provenance_index`** — not sent to a model: `{compiler: {name, version},
corpus_manifest_hash, documents, dossiers}`. `dossiers` maps a clause id to
the `{precedent_id, document_id, kind, omitted}` of each excerpt the dossier
selected, in selection order: first the excerpts it lists (`omitted` `false`,
in dossier order), then the ones it dropped whole to fit its budget
(`omitted` `true`), so every `omitted_precedent_ids` entry resolves here to
its deal and kind. `documents` has one `{document_id, signed_at,
version_files: [{version, sha256}]}` per deal behind those rows, kept or
omitted (sorted by id).

### 3.13 Identifier uniqueness (normative, effective 2026-07-29)

Every sibling-scoped id below MUST be **unique among its siblings**:

- `evidence.clauses[].id` — unique across the clause list.
- `evidence.precedent[].id` — unique across the precedent record (§3.5.4).
- `floor.invariants[].id` — unique across the Floor's invariant list.
- `corpus.documents[].document_id` — unique across the corpus.

The JSON Schema cannot express "unique across siblings," so this is enforced
only by a conformant validator, the same way §3.12's digest-consistency rule
is: **a conformant validator MUST reject a document containing a duplicate
sibling id** (fail-closed). Two siblings sharing an id make citation
resolution (§4) and any id-keyed export/digest projection genuinely
ambiguous — a consumer (or the compact `digest` of §3.12) keying off that id
alone cannot tell the siblings apart.

## 4. Citations

Every asserted clause text MUST be traceable.
```jsonc
{ "document_id": "string", "version": 4, "clause_path": "8.1", "char_span": [start, end] }
```
- `document_id`, `version`, and `clause_path` are REQUIRED; `char_span` is optional.
- `clause_path` is the dotted clause numbering in the normalized document, not the raw PDF page.
- `char_span`, when present, indexes into the document's full normalized text (document-relative — same coordinate system as `ClauseNode.char_span` in the clause-tree artifact), not the clause's own text. It spans the whole cited clause — from the start of its heading line through the end of its own body text (sub-clauses excluded; each carries its own span) — so a consumer resolving it lands on the clause language, not only its heading. (The reference engine also cuts an execution/signature block out of the clause that precedes it, so that block is not part of the clause text or its span.)
- `version` is the inferred ordinal (1-based); `"template"` is reserved for the baseline. Every citation's `(document_id, version)` MUST resolve against `corpus.documents` — dangling citations are non-conformant. When the cited document publishes `version_files` (§3.8), the cited version MUST have an entry there — a citation naming bytes no consumer can verify is likewise non-conformant.

### 4.1 Resolution algorithm (NEW)

A consumer holding the corpus files resolves a citation to verified bytes
without the compiler's workspace:

1. Read the citation's `(document_id, version, clause_path, char_span)`.
2. Look up `corpus.documents[document_id].version_files` and select the
   entry whose `version` matches; its `sha256` is the content address of
   the exact source file the compiler read. (For `"template"`, the address
   is `baseline.template_ref.sha256`.)
3. Locate a file in the consumer's own corpus copy whose bytes hash to
   that address — the hash, not any filename or directory layout, is the
   key. No match means the consumer's copy differs from the compiled-from
   corpus: fail loud, do not fall back to a near-name file.
4. Open the verified file and navigate by `clause_path` (dotted numbering
   in the normalized document) and, when present, `char_span`.

`playbook resolve-citation <playbook> --clause <id> --obs <n>
--corpus-dir <dir>` is the reference implementation of these steps.

## 5. The determinism boundary (NEW — normative)

A conformant consumer MUST treat the three sections with three different bindings:

| Section | Binding | The consumer MUST… |
|---|---|---|
| **Floor** | **Hard** | run the fail-closed coverage gate in code — every invariant evaluated and logged on every review, an unevaluated invariant fails the run; a `violation` verdict forces the outcome; the model and Posture cannot override it. The verdict itself is an LLM judgment (a dedicated Floor judge, with adversarial second-pass/escalation per the live-eval policy), not lexical matching — the determinism is in **coverage and consequence, not detection**. |
| **Posture** | **Soft** | compose into the model's instructions to shape judgment; never let it, alone, gate a decision. |
| **Evidence** | **Advisory** | surface to the model as cited material to reason over; never treat `historical_stance` as a directive. |

This is the load-bearing contract of v0.2: it is what lets a stochastic model be pointed at high-stakes legal work. The model gets freedom in the soft middle; the Floor is the guarantee underneath it.

## 6. Producer / author / consumer responsibilities (NEW)

| Concern | Producer (compiler) | Author (legal owner) | Consumer (review engine) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evidence | **populates** (auto-derived, cited) | — | surfaces to model; honors provenance + confidence |
| Posture | **drafts** from interview, grounded in Evidence | **edits & approves** | composes as soft instructions; versions edits under governance |
| Floor | **proposes** candidates from reversals/rejections | **authors & signs** | judges every invariant on every review (fail-closed coverage gate), forces the outcome on `violation` |
| Composition | **records** declared deps + integrity | **approves** module deps | loads only pinned+verified modules (fail-closed) |
| Corpus/compiler | **populates** | — | records lineage on every review |

## 7. Posture generation: the interview (NEW)

After compiling Evidence, the producer runs a short structured interview (the answers it cannot derive from the corpus — *forward-looking intent*) and drafts `posture.system_prompt` grounded in the Evidence (see §3.6 for what "drafts" and "grounded" mean for the reference producer, which assembles the prose deterministically from the answers rather than generating it with an LLM). The canonical starter set (3–6 questions; a producer MAY prune or extend):

1. **Rounds** — "How many negotiation rounds do you typically go on this agreement type before escalating or walking?"
2. **Leverage** — "What's your default leverage posture? (take-it-or-leave-it standard form / collaborative / we usually need the deal more than they do)"
3. **Risk appetite** — "When a counterparty change is non-material, do you default to accept-to-close, or hold the line?"
4. **Sacred clauses** — "Which clause types are non-negotiable regardless of deal value?" *(seeds Floor candidates — confirmed/signed by the author, never auto-promoted.)*
5. **Flexible clauses** — "Which clause types are you happy to concede to move a deal?"
6. **Output audience & deal-size sensitivity** — "Who will read the output, and does anything change above a deal-value threshold? (GC audience, terse rationale, no change by deal size / GC audience, terse rationale, but tightens above a threshold — say what threshold / junior-reviewer audience, needs it explained, no change by deal size / junior-reviewer audience, needs it explained, and tightens above a threshold — say what threshold)"

The mapping is explicit: **Q4** seeds Floor candidates; **Q1–3, 5–6** shape the Posture prose. The producer MUST record every question/answer in `posture.generation.interview` (§3.6).

## 8. Governance & lineage (NEW — boundary with the consumer)

OPF owns the *format*; the consuming app owns the *runtime lifecycle*. The boundary:

- The OPF carries the **genesis** Posture (compiler-generated) and the **signed** Floor. These are the starting state.
- Once installed, the consumer's release-bundle governance owns subsequent Posture/Floor versions. Each app-side version MUST record its parent OPF section digest, so the lineage **corpus → OPF(evidence+posture+floor) → installed bundle → edited posture version → decision** is reconstructible end to end.
- A consumer MUST record, on every review: the OPF identity + section digests, any edited-Posture version, the active Floor digest, and every composed module's `module@version#integrity`.
- Rollback and quarantine operate on the **bundle** (all sections + bound standard form + model policy), not on a single section in isolation.

(The concrete bundle/sign/activate/rollback mechanics live in the consuming app's governance docs; OPF only fixes the *lineage fields* the consumer must record.)

## 9. Confidence (unchanged)

Confidence is advisory, not statistical authority. It is a function of precedent count and provenance mix, with our-paper observations weighted above counterparty-paper. With small corpora most entries will be low-confidence; consumers MUST surface confidence and MUST NOT treat a single precedent as a rule.

## 10. Conformance

- A **conformant playbook** carries `opf_version` "0.5", validates against `spec/playbook.schema-0.5.json`, and obeys the normative rules in §2.3, §3.4, §3.5.4, §3.5.5, §3.6, §3.7, §3.8, §3.12, §3.13 and §5. A conformant validator rejects any other `opf_version` — including the retired "0.1" to "0.4" — as unsupported (`playbook_engine/validator.py`). The §2.2 evidence-depth rule capped a stance that 0.5 no longer carries, and paper side gates nothing.
- A **conformant producer** emits conformant playbooks, records out-of-scope documents, drafts the Posture from a recorded interview, and only *proposes* (never auto-promotes) Floor candidates.
- A **conformant consumer** honors the determinism boundary (§5), honors provenance (§2.3), surfaces confidence (§9) and citations (§4), loads only pinned+verified composed modules (§3.4), and records the lineage fields (§8).

### 10.1 Vendor extensions (`x_*`)

The schema reserves an `x_*` prefix for vendor extensions at designated
levels (the document root, `evidence.clauses[]` and their observations,
`clause_library[]` entries, `posture`, `floor` and its invariants,
and `corpus.documents[]` entries). Extensions are not
permitted where hash integrity or mechanical resolvability depends on a
closed shape (`identity`, citations, `agreement_type`, `taxonomy` entries,
`compiler`).

- Conformant consumers MUST ignore unknown `x_*` fields.
- Producers MUST NOT put normative behavior behind `x_*` fields — a
  playbook stripped of every `x_*` field must mean the same thing.
- `x_*` fields ARE content: they participate in `identity.content_hash`
  and the section digests, so two documents differing only in an `x_*`
  value are different playbooks.

### 10.2 Conformance vectors — canonicalization and digest (normative)

`spec/conformance/0.5/` is the **normative definition** of the two
mechanical algorithms everything in §3.10 (`identity`) and §3.12 (`digest`)
rests on: canonical serialization + content hashing (reference
implementation `playbook_engine/canonicalize.py`) and `digest` section
construction (reference implementation `playbook_engine/digest.py`).
`spec/conformance/0.5/manifest.json` stamps the exact `opf_version` /
`digest_version` / reference `engine_version` the vectors bind to, per the
§11 immutability rule below — a format-version bump gets a new,
separately-stamped vector set, never an in-place edit of an existing one.

Each vector under `spec/conformance/0.5/vectors/` is a self-contained,
plain-JSON `{input, expected}` pair (`canonical`, `content_hash`,
`section_digests`, `digest`, and, since issue #228, `manifest`, `dossiers`, `provenance_index`) — **an independent, non-Python implementation
that reproduces every vector's `expected.*` from its `input` is conformant**
with canonicalization and digest construction for that format version, with
no dependency on this repo. `tests/test_conformance_vectors.py` is this
engine's own check against the same frozen vectors; see
`spec/conformance/0.5/README.md` for what each vector isolates: canonical
serialization of 0.5-shaped documents and digest 4 construction — variant
grouping by §3.5.4's grouping key (including its counterparty-alias and
`perspective.party` neutralization), the `n_deals`/`last_signed` ordering,
the cap with uncapped totals, refused-ask grouping across deals, the
sentence-boundary summary, and `perspective` carried as `null` when the
document has none; vector 005 carries the opening evidence of §3.5.5; vector 006 pins the opening rules (`n_opened_standard`/`n_kept_standard`, `n_from_standard`/`n_unchanged`, `changed_openings` and its refused-ask exclusion); vector 007 pins the `vs_standard` collapse, tier order and `uncovered_clause_types`; vector 008 pins the hard-rule manifest (a presence or predicate rule names its clause), the dossier excerpt order (the concession's own record, the `signed_at` then lowest-`precedent_id` record order and a refused-ask excerpt) and the budget (a whole excerpt dropped and named, a single over-budget excerpt kept whole with its Floor rule dropped, and the last Floor rule dropped whole from a dossier with no excerpt so that it fits), and the provenance index with its corpus snapshot hash, source-file hashes and the dropped excerpt indexed as `omitted` with its deal (§3.12.3). The canonical-serialization algorithm itself is stated in
`spec/conformance/README.md`. (The OPF 0.3 / digest 2 vector set, which also
pinned key ordering, Unicode emission and float/int formatting edge cases,
was retired with that format, issue #238; those edge cases are unit-tested
in `tests/test_canonicalize.py`.)

This exists because a hand-maintained downstream port of `canonicalize.py`
or `digest.py` (Contract Toaster carries one, pinned to an engine commit by
docstring) fails silently on drift: a changed algorithm doesn't raise an
import error, it just produces a different `content_hash` — surfacing later
as an ingest-hash-verification failure, or worse, a hash that agrees when it
shouldn't.

## 11. Versioning & migration

OPF uses semantic versioning. `opf_version` is required.

**Stability policy (normative, effective at 1.0):** 1.0 is the first
non-beta release — the format is no longer "breaking changes possible until
1.0." Within the 1.x series:
- A 1.x release MAY add a new OPTIONAL field, or a new `x_*` vendor
  extension (§10.1).
- A 1.x release MUST NOT add a new REQUIRED field, remove or retype an
  existing field, or change what an existing field means or how its
  contents are selected.
- Removing or retyping a field, or changing a normative MUST, requires a
  2.0 release — never an in-place edit or a same-major-version reinterpretation
  of an existing rule.

**Normative rule changes (normative, effective at 1.0):** the drift class
that actually bites a consumer is a normative rule changing *without* a
schema change or a version bump — JSON Schema validation alone cannot catch
it. §3.13's id-uniqueness rule shipped in exactly this shape (a blocking
validator rule, no schema change, no version bump). Going forward, any new
or changed MUST — whether or not it touches the schema — MUST get an entry
in `CHANGELOG.md` under a dedicated `### Normative rule changes` heading in
the release it ships under, so a downstream implementation (including an
independent one checked against the conformance vectors, §10.2) has a
durable, greppable record of what changed.

**Immutability rule (normative, effective 2026-07-16):** a published
`opf_version` is immutable once a consumer exists. Shape or *semantic*
changes — including changes to what existing fields mean or how their
contents are selected — get a NEW `opf_version`, never an in-place edit of a
released schema; "old data still validates" is not sufficient. The `digest`
section's `digest_version` follows the same rule independently. Every
spec-affecting change gets an entry in `spec/CHANGELOG.md`, whose schema-hash
pins are CI-enforced (`tests/test_spec_consistency.py`).

**Retirement (2026-10-07, issue #238; 2026-10-08, issue #233).** With no
installed consumer, the owner retired OPF 0.1–0.3 and `digest_version` 2,
and 0.5 then replaced 0.4 in place (nothing consumed 0.4): the reference
engine emits and validates only 0.5, and a conformant validator rejects any other
`opf_version` as unsupported. Retirement removes a format from the
reference implementation; it never edits one — the retired schemas and
vectors are unchanged in git history and in contract-opf/opf.

**How the 1.x series relates to `opf_version` (normative):** the engine's
1.x series and the document shape's `opf_version` are versioned
independently, and the stability policy and the immutability rule above
compose as follows — an additive 1.x change (a new OPTIONAL field or `x_*`
extension, permitted by the stability policy) ships as a NEW `opf_version`
(e.g. 0.5 → 0.6), per the immutability rule; it is never an in-place edit
of a frozen shape. A consumer pinned to the earlier `opf_version` is
unaffected by such a change; a consumer that wants the new field upgrades
its pin to the new `opf_version`. "A published version is frozen" and "1.x
is additive-only" are therefore both true without conflict.

**Migrations.** The 0.1 → 0.2, 0.2 → 0.3, 0.3 → 0.4 and 0.4 → 0.5
migration notes described upgrade paths between formats the engine no longer
reads (issues #238, #233); they are in git history. A document in a retired
format is not converted: re-mine and re-project (`playbook mine`, then
`playbook project`), which emits 0.5. A store mined before 0.5 carries no
opening evidence, so it must be re-mined, not only re-projected.

## Appendix A — Open questions (for review, not yet decided)

1. **Composition mechanics (§3.4).** The governance contract is fixed; the *module interface* is not. Needs one investigation pass against a real consuming application's module structure before composition alters runtime behavior. Until then, `composes` is recorded for lineage but inert.
2. **Floor minimality (§3.7.1).** The admission test is the guard against the Floor regrowing into a rigid playbook. Worth pressure-testing on a mature production Floor: how many of its accumulated hard rejections survive *both* (a) categorical and (b) statable as a single judge-checkable invariant? The ones that fail (a) should become Posture; the ones that fail (b) should become Evidence guidance.
3. **`historical_stance` vs. a numeric tendency.** ~~`mixed` is coarse. A future version might carry a held-rate (e.g. "held in 7 of 9 our-paper deals") instead of/alongside the enum. Deferred.~~ **Resolved, then superseded:** 0.2/0.3 carried the held-rate as `summary.stance_detail`; 0.4 and 0.5 carry no stance at all, only per-clause deal counts (`n_signed_standard` of `n_deals`, §3.5.4).

## Appendix B — Changelog
- **0.5 (issue #234)** — `digest_version` "4" (§3.12.2) replaces digest 3 in place: per clause `n_opened_standard` / `n_kept_standard` / `positions`, `n_from_standard` and `n_unchanged` on each signed variant, `changed_openings` (with `n_changed_openings_total`), the `vs_standard` `label` on variants, asks and openings (equivalent variants collapse into one entry), and top-level `uncovered_clause_types`; `evidence.clauses[]` gains `n_opened_standard`, `n_kept_standard` and `n_changed_openings`. The 0.5 conformance set is regenerated for digest 4 with vectors 006 and 007.
- **0.5 (issue #240)** — Equivalence label (§3.5.6): an optional `vs_standard` `{label, reason, basis, check} | null` on `signed_text`, `opening_text` and each `refused_asks[]` entry, judged once per distinct text against our standard and blind-checked by an independent model; three new validator MUSTs.
- **0.5** — Opening evidence (§3.5.5): every precedent record gains `opened_with` (`standard` | `non_standard` | `absent` | `null`) and `opening_text` is recorded for any distinct opening, whatever its origin (0.4 recorded it only for our standard struck before signing). Three new validator MUSTs. The optional top-level `curation` section (§3.11) and `identity.section_digests.curation` are removed: the 0.5 schema rejects them (issue #233, after the review loop that produced pins was retired in issue #239). New schema file `playbook.schema-0.5.json`; it replaces 0.4 in the reference engine (no consumer ever bound 0.4). `digest_version` "3" is unchanged until digest 4 lands (epic #236); 0.5 has no consumer until contract-opf/contract-toaster#128 vendors it.
- **Retirement (issue #238)** — The reference engine reads and writes only 0.4 (now 0.5); OPF 0.1–0.3 and `digest_version` "2" are retired (validators reject them as unsupported). Not a new shape: 0.4 is unchanged. §3.5.1–§3.5.3 and §3.12's digest 2 rules are replaced by history notes.
- **0.4** — Verdict-free per-deal precedent record as the evidence shape (§3.5.4): `evidence.{clauses, precedent}` with distinct-deal counts, deterministic `standard`, three-valued paper metadata that gates nothing, and recomputable precedent ids; `digest_version` "3" (§3.12.1) with `perspective`, grouped signed variants and refused asks, and a digest-equals-recomputation rule; judged verdicts only under `x_judgments`. New schema file `playbook.schema-0.4.json`; 0.3 frozen.
- **1.0** — Stability commitment, not a shape change: the document shape (`opf_version` "0.3") is unchanged. New §11 stability policy (1.x changes are additive-only — new OPTIONAL fields and new `x_*` extensions permitted; no new REQUIRED field, no removing/retyping a field, no changing a normative MUST without a 2.0 release) and new §11 normative-rule-change policy (any new or changed MUST, whether or not it touches the schema, gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under a `### Normative rule changes` heading in the release it ships under).
- **0.3** — `digest` section (§3.12): compact model-facing projection of `evidence` (stances, preferred variations verbatim, text_summary-only concession/unacceptable summaries, frequency-banded deduplicated exemplar forms with `example_ref` drill-down); single-file bundle artifact `playbook.opf.html` embedding the canonical JSON + digest; additive over 0.2.
- **0.2** — Three-section model (Evidence / Posture / Floor); `historical_stance` (descriptive) replaces `rollup.position` (prescriptive); `composes` (pinned external modules); determinism boundary (§5); producer/author/consumer responsibilities (§6); Posture interview (§7); lineage boundary with the consumer (§8); `identity` — canonical serialization, `content_hash`, per-section digests, producer-assigned `id`/`version`/`supersedes` (§3.10, issue #143); `curation` — embedded attorney-pinned positions surviving recompile with deterministic conflict-flagging (§3.11, issue #147).
- **0.1** — Initial draft. Risk-delta model, provenance rule, dual structure (clause positions + clause library), citation requirement, taxonomy curation model.
